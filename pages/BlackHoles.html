            <h1 id="headerText">Black Holes Basics</h1>

            <p id="text">Black holes are among the most mysterious cosmic objects, much studied but not fully understood. 
            These objects aren’t really holes. They’re huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces.
            A black hole is so dense that gravity just beneath its surface, the event horizon, is strong enough
            that nothing – not even light – can escape. The event horizon isn’t a surface like Earth’s or even the
            Sun’s. It’s a boundary that contains all the matter that makes up the black hole.
            
            There is much we don’t know about black holes, like what matter looks like inside their event horizons. 
            However, there is a lot that scientists do know about black holes.

            <div id="textGroup">
                <p id="text">Black holes don’t emit or reflect light, making them effectively invisible to telescopes. 
                Scientists primarily detect and study them based on how they affect their surroundings:</p>

                <ul id="facts">
                    <li>Black holes can be surrounded by rings of gas and dust, called accretion disks, that
                    emit light across many wavelengths, including X-rays.</li>

                    <li>A supermassive black hole’s intense gravity can cause stars to orbit around it in a 
                    particular way. Astronomers tracked the orbits of several stars near the center of the
                    Milky Way to prove it houses a supermassive black hole, a discovery that won the 2020 
                    Nobel Prize.</li>
                
                    <li>When very massive objects accelerate through space, they create ripples in the fabric
                    of space-time called gravitational waves. Scientists can detect some of these by the 
                    ripples’ effect on detectors.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1 id="headerText">Black Holes Are Not ..</h1>

            <div id="textGroup">
                <ul id="facts">
                    <li>Wormholes. They don’t provide shortcuts between different points in space, or portals
                    to other dimensions or universes.</li>

                    <li>Cosmic vacuum cleaners. Black holes don’t suck in other matter. From far enough away, 
                    their gravitational effects are just like those of other objects of the same mass.</li>
